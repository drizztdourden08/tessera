# Design System Structure & Rules

The foundation for the app's UI is a set of design tokens plus a four-tier
component library. All code obeys @docs/contributing/coding-standards.md. For where
UI fits in the wider app, see @docs/architecture/overview.md.

## Where things live

All UI lives under `apps/web/src/ui/`, split into a reusable
`design-system/` and app-facing `domains/`:

```
ui/
├── design-system/          @ds/*  - reusable, domain-agnostic
│   ├── tokens/             concept files (color, space, size, radius, border,
│   │                       typography, shadow, motion, z-index, opacity, reset)
│   │                       + index.css (the single @import entry; imported once in main.tsx)
│   ├── primitives/         tier 1 - generic atoms; the one place raw HTML is allowed
│   └── composites/         tier 2 - generic structural combos
└── domains/                @domains/*  - domain-specific UI
    ├── app/
    │   ├── compounds/      tier 3 - domain presentational
    │   └── views/          tier 4 - page/feature with logic + data
    ├── widgets/            domain: overlay widgets
    └── hud/                domain: game HUD (own primitives/composites/compounds/views)
```

Aliases: `@ds/*` maps to `ui/design-system/*` and `@domains/*` to `ui/domains/*`, plus the
existing `@app/*` for `apps/web/src/*` and `@shared/*`. Non-presentational code
(`App/`, `stores/`, `lib/`, `hooks/`, `utils/`) stays at `src/` root.

## The four component tiers

Every UI component is exactly one tier. Pick the tier first, then build it in the
right folder. The first three are bare, self-contained, and presentational: data comes
in via props and callbacks, with no access to stores, `window.api`, `lib/game`, or
navigation. Only Views are wired to data and logic.

| Tier | What it is | Domain-aware? | Logic/data? | Lives in | Real examples |
|------|-----------|---------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Primitive** | Generic UI atom | No, generic | No | `components/primitives/` | Button, Select, Toggle, TextInput, Badge, Slider, TabBar, Toast |
| **Composite** | Generic **structural** unit built from primitives | No, generic | No | `components/composites/` | Card, Dialog, Overlay, DropdownMenu, FullScreenLayer, SettingsLayout, Widget |
| **Compound** | **Domain-specific** presentational unit composed from primitives/composites | Yes, a concept | No (data via props) | `components/compounds/` | ProfileCard, RomCard, SaveSlot, HeroSaveCard, CreateProfileForm |
| **View** | Page/feature with business logic + data | Yes | Yes: stores, IPC, game | `components/views/`, `widgets/` | ProfileHub, GameLayer, TrackerView, SpriteDebug, TitleBar |

**Primitive:** a generic atom with no domain knowledge. `<Button>`, `<Select>`,
`<Toggle>`. Pure props in, events out, reusable in any app.

**Composite:** a generic, reusable structural or layout component built from
primitives, still domain-agnostic. `<Card>`, `<Dialog>`, `<Overlay>`,
`<DropdownMenu>`. Often a small Facade over markup and tokens.

**Compound:** a domain-specific presentational component for a concrete concept,
composed from primitives and composites. `<ProfileCard>`, `<RomCard>`, `<SaveSlot>`.
It knows a domain shape (it takes a `Profile`/`Rom`/`Slot` prop) but stays bare: it
fetches nothing, owns no store, and fires callbacks up. Here "compound" means a
composed domain card or form, which is different from the React-Context "compound
components" pattern.

**View:** the container. Owns state via Zustand stores, `window.api` IPC, or
`lib/game`, and passes data and callbacks down into the bare tiers. It's the only tier
with business logic, which lives in its `behavior/` hooks.

> **Hard boundary:** primitives, composites, and compounds keep clear of stores,
> `window.api`, `lib/game`, and navigation imports. Data flows in via props only. If a
> bare component needs to fetch or subscribe, it is a View, so move it. This
> container/presentational split is what keeps the library reusable and testable.

### Choosing the tier

- Touches stores, IPC, game, or navigation, or owns state: **View**.
- Tied to a specific domain concept but purely presentational: **Compound**.
- Generic structural combo of primitives, domain-agnostic: **Composite**.
- Generic single atom: **Primitive**.

## Per-component structure (enforced by the structure-policy)

```
<tier>/<Name>/
├── <Name>.tsx          - one component, arrow fn, exports at end, ≤200 lines  ┐
├── <Name>.css          - scoped styles, tokens only, class names prefixed     │ ONLY
├── <Name>.type.ts      - <Name>Props etc. (exports at end)                    │ these
├── <Name>.constants.ts - static config (optional)                            │ at root
├── index.ts            - barrel (re-export only)                              ┘
├── behavior/           - hooks/handlers, one per file
└── sub-components/<Child>/  - children used only here (recursive: same shape)
```

Root files are name-prefixed (`<Name>.type.ts`, `<Name>.constants.ts`). The
structure-policy (R12, see below) flags any other file at the component root, or any
subfolder besides `behavior/` and `sub-components/`.

## Rules

**Tokens**

1. `ui/design-system/tokens/` (one concept file per category) is the single
   source of truth. Use `var(--token)`, with no raw hex and no magic px.
2. For a new design value, add a token first, then use it.
3. Get readability from value contrast and the spacing scale, not ad-hoc numbers.

**Components**
4. One component per folder; one thing per file; ≤200 lines; arrow fn; exports at end.
5. **Rule of two:** a UI pattern used 2+ times gets extracted to the right tier rather
   than copy-pasted. The second occurrence is the trigger.
6. Express variants via props and data-attributes/CSS, not duplicated components
   (`<Button variant="danger">`, not `DangerButton`).

**Styling**
7. Colocate CSS as `<Name>.css` with scoped, prefixed class names so nothing bleeds
   globally. Prefer CSS over inline `style`.
8. Reserve inline `style={{}}` for dynamic values such as computed transforms
   and measured sizes.

**Boundaries**
9. `ui/design-system/` holds tokens plus reusable primitives and composites, free of
   logic and data imports (see the hard boundary above). Domain UI lives in `ui/domains/`.
10. Views compose the lower tiers and leave primitive styling to the primitives.

## Mechanical enforcement

Three policies back the rules above. They start as warnings and flip to errors once
each reaches zero. See the full rules table in
@docs/contributing/coding-standards.md.

| Rule | Tool | What it flags |
|------|------|---------------|
| **R11 no-raw-html** | ESLint (`local/no-raw-html`) | any lowercase JSX element outside `primitives/`; use `Box`/`Text`/`Flex`/`Button`/... |
| **R12 structure-policy** | analyze adapter | component-root files other than `<Name>.{tsx,css,type.ts,constants.ts}`+`index.ts`, or subfolders other than `behavior/`/`sub-components/` |
| **R13 token-policy** | stylelint (`color-no-hex`, `color-named`) | raw hex / named colors in `ui/**` component CSS (tokens/ exempt) |

Reports: `npm run report` (all three) · `report:html` · `report:structure` ·
`report:tokens`. Form controls (`input`/`select`/`textarea`) are already a hard
error outside primitives.

## Growing it

For a new UI need, pick the tier (above), then check for an existing component to reuse.
If none exists and it's reusable, create it in the right tier folder, and wire data only at
the View tier. Every change runs the `coding-standards` checkup and is placed per
@docs/architecture/overview.md.
